/*

Overall, this code defines a Mongoose schema for a user object with "username" and "password" fields, and exports it as a model called "User". This model can be used in other parts of the application to create, read, update, and delete user objects in a MongoDB database.

When you insert data into a MongoDB database using Mongoose, if the database or collection you specified in your Mongoose model does not exist, MongoDB will automatically create it for you.

const mongoose = require("mongoose");
const UserSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  username: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
  },
  password: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
  }
}, { collection: "mycollection" });
const User = mongoose.model("User", UserSchema, "mydatabase");
module.exports = User;

In your case, it appears that you did not define a specific database or collection in your Mongoose model, so when you insert data into the database, MongoDB creates a database called "test" and a collection with a default name of "users" (i.e., test.users) to store the data.
